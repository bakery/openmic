# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why does this project exist?

The JavaScript ecosystem evolves at incredible speed: staying current can feel
overwhelming. So, instead of you having to stay on top of every new tool,
feature and technique to hit the headlines, this project aims to lighten the
load by providing a curated baseline of the most valuable ones.

Using React Boilerplate, you get to start your app with our community's current
ideas on what represents optimal developer experience, best practice, most
efficient tooling and cleanest project structure.

## Where are the files coming from when I run `$ npm start`?

In development Webpack compiles your application runs it in-memory. Only when
you run `$ npm run build` will it write to disk and preserve your bundled
application across computer restarts.

## Can I use Sass with this boilerplate?

Yes, although we advise against it and **do not support this**.

As an alternative, consider installing a plugin called `PreCSS`: it lets you use
familiar syntax - $variables, nesting, mixins, etc. - but still benefit from
Autoprefixer, postcss-focus, etc.

If you _really_ still want to use Sass then...

1. Change `internals/webpack/webpack.base.babel.js` so that line 22 reads
    ```JavaScript
    test: /\.s?css$/,
    ```

1. Update each of

    - `internals/webpack/webpack.dev.babel.js`
    - `internals/webpack/webpack.prod.babel.js`

    changing the config option for cssLoaders to

    ```JavaScript
    cssLoaders: 'style-loader!css-loader?modules&importLoaders=1&sourceMap!postcss-loader!sass-loader',
    ```

    Then run `npm i -D sass-loader`

...and you should be good to go!

## How do I fix `Error: listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:3000`?

This simply means that there's another process already listening on port 3000.
The fix is to kill the process and rerun `npm start`.

### OS X:

1. Find the process id (PID):
    ```Shell
    $ ps aux | grep node
    ```
    > This will return the PID as the value following your username:
    > ```Shell
    > $ janedoe    29811  49.1  2.1  3394936 356956 s004  S+    4:45pm   2:40.07 node internals/webpack/server.dev.js
    > ```

1. Then run
    ```Shell
    $ kill -9 YOUR_PID
    ```
    > e.g. given the output from the example above, `YOUR_PID` is `29811`, hence
    that would mean you would run `kill -9 29811`

### Windows

1. Find the process id (PID):
    ```Shell
    C:\> netstat -a -o -n
    ```

    > This will return a list of running processes and the ports they're
    listening on:
    > ```
    > Proto     Local Address     Foreign Address   State       PID
    > TCP       0.0.0.0:25        0.0.0.0:0         Listening   4196
    > ...
    > TCP       0.0.0.0:3000      0.0.0.0:0         Listening   28344
    ```

1. Then run
    ```Shell
    C:\> taskkill /F /PID YOUR_PID
    ```
    > e.g. given the output from the example above, `YOUR_PID` is `28344`, hence
    that would mean you would run `taskkill /F /PID 28344`
