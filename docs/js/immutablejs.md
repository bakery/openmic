# ImmutableJS

Immutable data structures can be deeply compared in no time. This allows us to
efficiently determine if our components need to rerender since we know if the
`props` changed or not!

Check out the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
for a good explanation of the more intricate benefits it has.

## Usage

In our reducers, we make the initial state an immutable data structure with the
`fromJS` function. We pass it an object or an array, and it takes care of
converting it to a compatible one. (Note: the conversion is performed deeply so
that even arbitrarily nested arrays/objects are immutable stuctures too!)

```JS
import { fromJS } from 'immutable';

const initialState = fromJS({
  myData: 'Hello World!',
});
```

To react to an incoming actions our reducers can use the `.set` and the `.setIn`
functions.

```JS
import { SOME_ACTION } from './actions';

// [â€¦]

function myReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SOME_ACTION:
      return state.set('myData', action.payload);
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

We use [`reselect`](./reselect.md) to efficiently cache our computed application
state. Since that state is now immutable, we need to use the `.get` and `.getIn`
functions to select the part we want.

```JS
const myDataSelector = (state) => state.get('myData');

export default myDataSelector;
```
