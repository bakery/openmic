# Routing via `react-router` and `react-router-redux`

`react-router` is the de-facto standard routing solution for react applications.
The thing is that with redux and a single state tree, the URL is part of that
state. `react-router-redux` takes care of synchronizing the location of our
application with the application state.

(See the [`react-router-redux` documentation](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) for more information)

## Usage

To add a new route, use the generator with `$ npm run generate route`.

This is what a standard (generated) route looks like for a container:

```JS
{
  path: '/',
  getComponent: function get(location, cb) {
    require.ensure([], (require) => {
      injectAsyncReducer(store, 'home', require('HomePage/reducer').default);
      cb(null, require('HomePage').default);
    }, 'HomePage');
  },
}
```

> Don't worry about all of that `require.ensure` and `injectAsyncReducer` stuff, it's there to make code splitting routes work. See [this blog post](http://blog.mxstbr.com/2016/01/react-apps-with-pages) for more information!

To go to a new page use the `push` function by `react-router-redux`:

```JS
import { push } from 'react-router-redux';

push('/some/page');
```
