            <p>Using <A href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr"><strong>react-transform-hmr</strong></A>, your changes in the CSS and JS get reflected in the app instantly without refreshing the page. That means that the <strong>current application state persists</strong> even when you change something in the underlying code! For a very good explanation and demo watch Dan Abramov himself <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs">talking about it at react-europe</A>.</p>

            <p><A href="https://github.com/gaearon/redux"><strong>Redux</strong></A> is a much better implementation of a flux–like, unidirectional data flow. Redux makes actions composable, reduces the boilerplate code and makes hot–reloading possible in the first place. For a good overview of redux check out the talk linked above or the <A href="https://gaearon.github.io/redux/">official documentation</A>!</p>

            <p><A href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss"><strong>PostCSS</strong></A> is like Sass, but modular and capable of much more. PostCSS is, in essence, just a wrapper for plugins which exposes an easy to use, but very powerful API. While it is possible to <A href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/precss">replicate Sass features</A> with PostCSS, PostCSS has an <A href="http://postcss.parts">ecosystem of amazing plugins</A> with functionalities Sass cannot even dream about having.</p>

            <p><strong>Unit tests</strong> should be an important part of every web application developers toolchain. <A href="https://github.com/mochajs/mocha">Mocha</A> checks your application is working exactly how it should without you lifting a single finger. Congratulations, you just won a First Class ticket to world domaination, fasten your seat belt please!</p>

            <p><A href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router"><strong>react-router</strong></A> is used for routing in this boilerplate. react-router makes routing really easy to do and takes care of a lot of the work.</p>
